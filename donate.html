		<p style="color:white;">Google Ngram Viewer is a web-based tool that allows users to search and analyze the frequency of words and phrases in a vast corpus of books that Google has scanned and digitized. It was introduced in 2010 as part of the Google Books project.

			Using the tool, users can enter one or more words or phrases and generate a graph that shows the frequency of those terms over a selected period of time. The Ngram Viewer can display data from a variety of languages and allows users to adjust the time period and other parameters to refine their search.

			One of the unique features of the Google Ngram Viewer is that it can display the frequency of multiple terms on the same graph, allowing users to compare the usage of different words or phrases over time. Additionally, the tool allows users to search for specific forms of words, such as plural or past tense forms.

			Google Ngram Viewer has been used by researchers in a variety of fields, including linguistics, history, and social sciences, to study language usage and cultural trends over time. It has also been used to analyze the impact of specific historical events or technological innovations on language use.</p>
